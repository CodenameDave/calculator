Welcome to my calculator.  I don't expect it to be pretty but I am excited to take
on a project with little direction.  So far I've learned HTML/CSS and Javascript fundamentals.  I feel like I have enough in my toolkit to give it a good go
I'm just trying to solidify what I have learned and even though I have just started I have noticed I have forgotten some things.  I started on my windows machine
and then realized I should be using GitHub to share my data, and thats setup on my Linux machine.   I want to primarily use Linux for my coding.    


Not much to explain about the calculator.  For now I want it to just look like a calculator, which it does!

Next will be to get the buttons to work.  Starting with just numbers and then I will work on the operators and more complex items.

After I'm happy with the functionality of the buttons using console.log I will move on to making the  screen work using Javascript and DOM manipulation

Finally I will work on my CSS skills and try to make it look more fancy.
